        E is a multi-purpose command & control server designed to receive commands through the <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> chat protocol and forward them to clients. While C&C servers are usually thought of in the context of malware, and E could indeed be used for this purpose, E can also be used for any number of things, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>controlling IoT devices via a text message (both on Matrix and also any bridged protocol)</li>
        <li>administering a large number of devices in business settings</li>
        <li>sending Matrix messages over any protocol providing there is an E module for it</li>
      </ul>
